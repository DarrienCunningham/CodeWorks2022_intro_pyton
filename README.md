# Project 12 -- Python Modules (Part 2)

# Expense report
use the data in the expense report to create a figure with three graphs on one plot as a function of time
 - import the file however you like and save it as four lists (month, income, expense, profit)
 - the first graph is the monthly income (green color)
 - the second graph is the monthly expense (red color)
 - the third one is the net profit (blue color)
 - add a legend, a grid only along the y-axis, and axis labels (months, $ amount)
