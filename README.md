## Vehicle
create a class Vehicle with instance variables 'name', 'color' and a method 'max_speed' which print's out 'max speed'.
then create two other classes called Car and Bus which inherit Vehicle class and overide the 'max_speed' function so that it print's out 150 for the bus and 250 for the car
