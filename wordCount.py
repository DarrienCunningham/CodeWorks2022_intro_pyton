Cause I might have the check in the mail I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail Hungry little bunny I am coming for your tail So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails"

#your code here
#------------------------------------#------------------------------------
#Hints:
#1) loop through the list
for word in list:
    if word not in myDict:
        myDict.update({ word : 1})
    else:
        myDict[word] = myDict[word] + 1
#2) check if the word is counted or not. if it's not counted add it to the dictionary as a new element but if it is count, update the count.

#print out the dictionary
